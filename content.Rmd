## [Customer Segmentation: Clustering](cluster_seg.html)

In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviors of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.

## [Sales Analysis](sales_analysis.html)

In this project I used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

## [Correlation in Movie Industry](corr_movie.html)

For this project the first questions that came to my mind was: Is the movie industry dying? Is Netflix the new entertainment king?
And the best way to answer those is analyzing that dataset of *four decades* using Pandas, Matpoltlib and Seaborn to also understand more factors that intervene in this industry, like actors, genres, user ratings and more.
