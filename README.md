# Portfolio_Website

Hello everyone ✋ 

⭐ My full name is Matheus Ragghianti Cordeiro de Garcia, yes I know it is a very long name. Don't worry to remember all of those last names, I just go for Matheus Cordeiro, it is good enough. 

📖 At this moment, in March 2022 I'm pursuing my Master's Degree in Business Analytics at the California Polytechnic State University - Pomona, and I will be graduating in August this year. 

➡️ The objective of this repository is to insert all files that my portfolio website will contain. I have used R Markdown to build this website, creating codes on R, Python, SQL, and showing my Tableau Dashboards. 

👨‍💻 I have a passion for analyzing data and problem solving, and how it can facilitate innovation. I hope this repository can show some of my passion and inspire you as well to create and develop your own website, sharing good ideas with others. 

📧 To contact me, please send me an email thru: matheusr@cpp.edu and I will happy to talk to you! 

Have a great experience!
